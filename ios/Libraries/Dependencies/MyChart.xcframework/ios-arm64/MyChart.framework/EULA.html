<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-weight:bold;color:black'>17. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>a. <u>APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION
AGREEMENT.</u> Any dispute, claim or controversy of any nature arising out of
or relating in any way to the App, this Agreement, or this Arbitration
Agreement (as defined below), including without limitation the interpretation,
validity, scope, or applicability of this Agreement or the Arbitration
Agreement (hereinafter, collectively, the “Dispute”), which cannot be resolved
informally, shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual, and not
a class or representative, basis under the terms set forth  in this Section 17
(the “Arbitration Agreement”). This Arbitration Agreement applies to You and
Epic (collectively, the “Parties”) and the Parties’ subsidiaries, affiliates,
agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors in interest, and
assigns. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY
TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THEIR
CASE, AND MAY HAVE HAD A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION
OR OTHER PROCEEDING INVOLVING MULTIPLE CLAIMANTS, BUT THEY INSTEAD CHOOSE AND
AGREE TO HAVE ALL DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN DECIDED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL
ARBITRATION.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>b. <u>DISPUTES EXCLUDED FROM
ARBITRATION</u>.  In the event of any actual, alleged or threatened violation
of confidentiality or violation of Epic’s or Your Provider’s intellectual
property or other proprietary rights, Epic may immediately resort to court
proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction as set forth above in order to
seek immediate injunctive relief without posting of a bond, proof of damages or
other similar requirement. The institution of any action for injunctive relief
shall not constitute a waiver of the right or obligation of any party to submit
any claim seeking relief other than injunctive relief to arbitration. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>c. <u>CONFIDENTIAL PROCEEDINGS</u>.
The Parties expressly agree that any and all actions taken under the
Arbitration Agreement and related provisions, including but not limited to all
filings, orders, judgments, and awards made in any arbitration proceeding, are
confidential and may not be disclosed to any third party, except as otherwise
may be required by law.   </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>d. <u>ARBITRATOR</u>. The
arbitration proceeding will be administered by the American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”) under the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules (the
&quot;Rules&quot;) before a single arbitrator selected pursuant to the Rules. Epic
will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the
arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding. Any
final award or judgment may be filed and enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in !msorm'><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>e. <u>PLACE AND GOVERNING LAW.</u>
The place of arbitration shall be in Dane County, Wisconsin, unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by all parties to the arbitration. The Parties acknowledge
that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate
commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., as may be
amended from time to time, shall govern the interpretation, enforcement and
proceedings pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent state law is
applicable, the laws of the State of Wisconsin shall apply without regard to
conflict of laws provisions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>f. <u>TIME LIMITATION ON CLAIMS.</u>
The Parties agree that they must initiate arbitration within one (1) year after
any Dispute arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>g. <u>CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL
WAIVER</u>. YOU AND EPIC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER
IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both You
and Epic agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate one or more
person’s claims with Your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form
of a representative or class proceeding. If there is a final judicial
determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Paragraph's
limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that
claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court. EACH
PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, CLAIM, OR PROCEEDING ARISING HEREUNDER, RELATING TO,
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EPIC’S RIGHT TO
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SET FORTH IN SECTION 17(b).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-weight:bold;color:black'>18. GENERAL</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>This Agreement sets forth the
entire agreement between Epic and You with regard to the App. All prior or
contemporaneous representations, understandings or agreements are superseded by
this Agreement. Except as set forth in this Agreement, any modification or
amendment of this Agreement must be in writing, and signed by both parties. Any
failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be
deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other
occasion. You and Epic are independent parties and this Agreement does not
create any agent, employer, employee or joint venture relationship between You
and Epic. This Agreement does not give You or Epic the right or ability to bind
or enter into any obligation on behalf of the other. The prevailing party in
any Dispute under this Agreement will be entitled to receive its costs, expert
witness fees and reasonable attorneys’ fees, including costs and fees on
appeal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-weight:bold;color:black'>19. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR iOS
USERS ONLY</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>a. This Agreement is solely
between You and Epic, not Apple. As between Epic and Apple, Epic, not Apple, is
responsible for the App and the terms of this Agreement. However, Apple and
Apple’s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of the Agreement. Once You
accept this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have
accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against You.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>b. Apple is not responsible or
liable for the App or the App content and is not responsible for addressing any
claims by You or any third party relating to the App or Your possession and/or
use of the App, including without limitation: (1) product liability claims; (2)
any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory
requirement; and (3) claims arising under consumer protection or similar
legislation. Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support services
for the App.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>c. In the event of any third party
claim that the App or Your possession and use of that App infringes on any
third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Epic and Apple, it is
Epic and not Apple that will be solely responsible for the investigation,
defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property
infringement claim. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in !msorm'><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>d. In the event the App fails to
conform to any applicable warranty, You may notify Apple and You will be
refunded any purchase price, if applicable, for the App. To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation
whatsoever with respect to the App, and Apple has no responsibility for any
other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to
any failure to conform to any warranty. As between Epic and Apple, Epic, not
Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims relating to the App or Your
possession and/or use of the App. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>e. In addition to the license
terms above, You may also access, acquire, and use the App on other accounts
associated with You via Family Sharing or volume purchasing. Your use of the
App is also subject to any applicable Apple terms or service. </span></p>
