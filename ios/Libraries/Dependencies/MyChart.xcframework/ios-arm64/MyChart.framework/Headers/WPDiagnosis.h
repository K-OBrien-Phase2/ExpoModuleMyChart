//  *csatish 5/11 199912 Removed "icd" definition which previously would have contained ICD-9 code but was retired in Epic-2010. 
//                       From Epic-2010 or later, "icd" was replaced with "code" and "codeset" which needs to be defined later when 
//                       we implement content linking on iPhone.
